#General
Domain
Currently Spotify offers a plethora of playlists ranging from types of moods, and genre, however only one commonly followed playlist declares and puts forward an attempt at a genre-less playlist.  This playlist is called Pollen.  Pollen is “a playlist based around a radical premise: It was not organized by genre.”  This playlist has 410,000 followers and is made up of 120 tracks.  A testimony to Pollen’s listeners from Hope Tala, a producer of an artist with 450,000 monthly listeners, exclaims “We’ve been on other playlists that have higher follower numbers, but the engagement on Pollen is mad….This is not like a mid-day cafe background playlist; this is a, I-need-to-listen-to-this-today” (1).
